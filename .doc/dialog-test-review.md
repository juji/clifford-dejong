## Review of `apps/web/__test__/dialog.test.tsx`

This test file is very well-structured and comprehensive, effectively translating the detailed testing plan into executable tests. It demonstrates a strong understanding of the `Dialog` component's functionality and testing best practices, particularly in the area of accessibility.

### Strengths:

*   **Overall Structure and Setup:** The use of `userEvent.setup()` and the `renderBasicDialog` helper function are excellent for reducing redundancy and setting up consistent test environments.
*   **Comprehensive Coverage:** Most aspects of the testing plan are covered, including basic open/close functionality, `showCloseButton` prop, and crucial accessibility features.
*   **Robust Accessibility Testing:** The tests for focus management (`traps focus within dialog`, `returns focus to trigger when closed`) and ARIA attributes (`has correct ARIA attributes when open`) are particularly strong and well-implemented. The dynamic retrieval of `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` IDs is a robust approach.
*   **Effective Mocking:** No explicit mocks for `Dialog` components themselves, which aligns with the intent to test the wrapper functionality and custom modifications.

### Missing/Incomplete Tests (Areas for Improvement to fully align with the detailed plan):

*   **Explicit Styling Class Assertions for `DialogContent`:**
    *   The test plan explicitly requested verification of numerous styling classes on the `DialogContent` element itself (e.g., `bg-background`, `fixed top-[50%] left-[50%]`, `z-50`, `grid`, `w-full`, `max-w-[calc(100%-2rem)]`, `translate-x-[-50%]`, `translate-y-[-50%]`, `gap-4`, `rounded-lg`, `border`, `p-6`, `shadow-lg`, `duration-200`, `sm:max-w-lg`). These assertions are currently missing from the test file.
    *   Similarly, explicit verification of animation classes (`data-[state=open]:animate-in`, `data-[state=closed]:animate-out`, `fade-out-0`, `fade-in-0`, `zoom-out-95`, `zoom-in-95`, `data-[side=bottom]:slide-in-from-top-2`, `data-[side=left]:slide-in-from-right-2`, `data-[side=right]:slide-in-from-left-2`, `data-[side=top]:slide-in-from-bottom-2`) on `DialogContent` is missing.

*   **Explicit Styling Class Assertions for `DialogHeader`, `DialogFooter`, `DialogTitle`, `DialogDescription`:**
    *   The test plan specified verifying classes for these sub-components (e.g., `DialogHeader` having `flex flex-col gap-2 text-center sm:text-left`). These explicit class assertions are missing.

*   **Prop Propagation for `className`:**
    *   There are no explicit tests verifying that custom `className` props passed to `DialogOverlay`, `DialogContent`, `DialogHeader`, `DialogFooter`, `DialogTitle`, and `DialogDescription` are correctly applied and merged with the default classes.

### Recommendation:

To fully align with the detailed testing plan and ensure complete coverage, it is recommended to add the missing explicit styling class assertions for `DialogContent`, `DialogHeader`, `DialogFooter`, `DialogTitle`, and `DialogDescription`, as well as tests for `className` prop propagation. This will ensure that all custom styling and layout defined in the component are correctly applied.
