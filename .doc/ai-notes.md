# AI Notes & Conventions

This document was generated by GitHub Copilot. It is a living reference for conventions and workflow preferences in this project.

## Message to AI
- Treat all manual edits and creations as canonical. Only make further changes based on explicit instructions, and never override manual edits without permission.
- Simpler is better. Do not add extra options, details, or files unless explicitly requested.
- Prioritize direct, minimal, and explicit instructions.
- Before committing, always present a summary or diff of the actual changes for review and approval, unless instructed otherwise.

## Commit Message Conventions
- Commit messages should be concise but descriptive, summarizing the purpose and scope of the change.
- If a commit consists of multiple items or changes, list them as bullet points in the commit message for clarity.
- If a commit fails due to linting, tests, or other checks, and you need to fix and recommit, always reuse the original commit message.

## File naming conventions
- Always use kebab-case for filenames, even for TypeScript files. For example, use `attractor-store.ts` instead of `AttractorStore.ts`.
- If you need to create a new file, use kebab-case for the filename as well.
- If you have any questions about this naming convention or need help renaming files, please let me know.
- it kinda feel rebelious if you think about it. (not gonna change the typo error)
