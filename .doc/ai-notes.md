## Message to AI
- Treat all manual edits and creations as canonical. Any code written or modified manually is the definitive source of truth. Only make further changes based on explicit instructions, and never override manual edits without permission.
- Simpler is better. Do not add extra options, details, or files unless explicitly requested.
- Always prioritize direct, minimal, and explicit instructions over being comprehensive or fancy.
- More is not always better.
- If in doubt, ask for clarification instead of assuming more is needed.
- Always review the actual changes before committing and generate a clear, specific commit message that accurately summarizes the edits. Do not use generic commit messages.
- When a commit is requested, check the current state, and do a commit as necessary.

## Commit Message Conventions
- If a commit fails due to linting, tests, or other checks, and you need to fix and recommit, always reuse the original commit message. This keeps the commit history clear and preserves the original intent.
- Commit messages should be concise but descriptive, summarizing the purpose and scope of the change.
- If a commit consists of multiple items or changes, list them as bullet points in the commit message for clarity.

## File naming conventions
- Always use kebab-case for filenames, even when the file is a TypeScript file. This is a common convention in web development and helps maintain consistency across your project. For example, instead of naming a file `AttractorStore.ts`, you would name it `attractor-store.ts`. This applies to all files, including those that contain TypeScript code.
- If you have a file that is currently named `AttractorStore.ts`, please rename it to `attractor-store.ts`. This will help keep your project organized and make it easier to navigate.
- If you need to create a new file, use kebab-case for the filename as well.
- For example, if you are creating a new file for a Zustand store, you might name it `attractor-store.ts`. If you are creating a new file for a worker, you might name it `mock-worker.ts`.
- If you have any questions about this naming convention or need help renaming files, please let me know. I can assist you with the renaming process or provide guidance on how to implement this convention in your project.
- it kinda feel rebelious if you think about it. (not gonna change the typo error)
