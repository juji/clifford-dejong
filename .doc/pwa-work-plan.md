# Work Plan: PWA Integration for Next.js App

## Goal
Integrate Progressive Web App (PWA) support into the Next.js app in `apps/web` using best practices and Next.js conventions.

## Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**
   - [x] Add `next-pwa` to `apps/web`.

2. **Update Next.js Configuration**
   - [x] Edit `next.config.js` to wrap the config with `next-pwa` and enable PWA in production.

3. **Add Manifest and Icons**
   - [x] Create `public/manifest.json` with app details.
   - [x] Add required icons (all standard Android, iOS, and Windows icons) to `public/icons/`.

4. **Update Document Structure**
   - [ ] Add meta tags and manifest links in `app/layout.tsx` using the `<Head>` component or the metadata API, as this project uses the App Router (Next.js 13+).

5. **Test PWA Functionality**
   - [ ] Build the app and verify service worker registration, offline support, and manifest loading.
   - [ ] Test with Lighthouse or similar tools for PWA compliance.

6. **Document the Integration**
   - [ ] Update project documentation to describe PWA features and how to maintain them.

## Notes
- Remove any incorrect or unused files (e.g., `public/_document.html`).
- Follow Next.js and project conventions for all changes.
- Ensure accessibility and performance are not negatively impacted by PWA features.
